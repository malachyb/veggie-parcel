            <h4><b>About Us</b></h4>
            <p>The basic idea of our website is to allow customers to buy all sorts of vegetables related gift products,
                and put down the messages that they want to carve into the vegetables. Whether they want to let friends
                and family members have an unforgettable gift, or just for trolls to make one another happy. This is the
                perfect website to buy memorable gifts that are unique and fun. The goal of this website is to bring
                laughter and smiles on people’s faces. We want them to have a unique experience with a gift that they
                never have received before. Instead of giving some traditional gifts like cards, chocolates etcs. We
                want to break the traditional barriers and make a gift that not only can bring joy and happiness to
                people but also make things interesting, rather than having some traditional, boring gifts.</p>

            <p>Customers can customize their gifts with different choices of vegetables. Whether it’s images or just
                lines of words. We’ll wrap them up nicely and also pack into a box with all stuff that is associated
                with your chosen vegetables. We also have a mystery box section where if the user wants to have more
                mystery vibe but don’t know which vegetables to pick. We’ll be picking a random selection of vegetables
                and sending it to the customer, who doesn’t know what they are going to get.</p>
